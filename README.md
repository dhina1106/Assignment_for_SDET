# Assignment_for_SDET

# The code starts with several import statements, importing various classes and libraries, including Selenium WebDriver, Gson (a Java library for working with JSON data), and TestNG for assertions.

# public class Post:
This defines a Java class named "Post," which serves as the entry point of the program.

# public static void main(String[] args):
This is the main method where the execution of the program begins. It throws several exceptions, including JsonSyntaxException, JsonIOException, and FileNotFoundException, which are exceptions that may be thrown when working with JSON files and WebDriver.

# WebDriver Initialization:
It creates an instance of the FirefoxDriver, which is a part of the Selenium WebDriver framework. This driver is used for automating interactions with a web page.

# Navigating to a Web Page:
The driver.get() method is used to open a web page with the URL "https://testpages.herokuapp.com/styled/tag/dynamic-table.html."

# Locating and Interacting with Elements:
It uses Selenium to interact with elements on the web page. For example, it finds a summary element with the text "Table Data" and clicks on it.

# JSON Data Handling:
It seems to be working with JSON data. It locates an element with the ID "jsondata" and clears its contents. Then, it uses the Gson library to parse JSON data directly from a JSON string that is manually constructed within the code.

# Sending JSON Data to the Web Page:
The manually constructed JSON data is sent to the web page by filling the "jsondata" input element with the JSON string.

# Implicit Wait:
It sets an implicit wait of 5 seconds, which means the WebDriver will wait for up to 5 seconds for elements to become available before throwing an exception.

# Refreshing the Table:
It clicks a button with the text "Refresh Table" on the web page, which appears to trigger some action that may change the displayed data.

# Validation:
It attempts to retrieve the attribute of the "jsondata" input element and stores it in the actualdata variable. After that, it performs an assertion using TestNG's Assert.assertEquals() method. This assertion compares the actualdata with the expected JSON data that was parsed from the JSON string within the code. The last argument "TestData Added" seems to be a description for the assertion, indicating that the test is checking if the test data has been added successfully.
